1) In ShoppingCart, define a method totalPrice() that returns the total amount of the products it contains.



2) Now let's say that, if you buy 5 products or more, you have a 10% of discount. Change totalPrice to reflect this calculation.



3) Besides the previous discount, if you buy 3 items of the same type (e.g. 3 pencils) you may get one more for free. 
So, if you buy 4 pencils you only pay 3, if you buy 8 pencils you only pay 6, etc. Change totalPrice so it considers the free items you get. 
Notice that if you buy 3 pencils you just pay the 3 of them.



4) Sometimes a product is sold out and has to be replaced by a new one. 
Add a method replace(productName, replacementProduct) that looks for products with productName and replaces them by new instances of the product like replacementProduct.
Notice that productName is a string, and replacementProduct is a Product. 
Also, bear in mind that you don't have to add the replacementProduct itself to the cart, but create new products like that one (whenever necessary).


Important: always implement one exercise at a time (if possible just parts of it), and test each solution (or each change) with different combinations of products.
